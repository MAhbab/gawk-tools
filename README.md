# gawk-tools ðŸª¶

A modular command-line toolkit for handy `gawk` scripts, designed to grow gradually and stay easy to maintain.

## âœ¨ Overview

`gawk-tools` is a single-entry-point CLI that dispatches to useful `awk` scripts. It's meant for users who regularly do one-off data manipulations, CSV inspection, and text processing from the terminalâ€”and want something scalable beyond a mess of aliases.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone this repo and make the `gawk-tools` script executable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gawk-tools.git
cd gawk-tools
chmod +x gawk-tools
```

Then optionally add it to your `PATH`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/path/to/gawk-tools:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc # or ~/.bashrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can run:

```bash
gawk-tools <command> [args...]
```

## ðŸ”§ Available Commands

To see all available commands:

```bash
gawk-tools help
```

To get help for a specific command:

```bash
gawk-tools help <command>
```

## ðŸ§ª Example Scripts

- `show-columns`: Print header columns of a CSV file with their index
- `bq-dryrun`: Parse BigQuery dry run output and show estimated bytes in GB

Each script is self-documented with a `# Usage:` comment and optional inline help.

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

- One entry point (`gawk-tools`)
- Drop-in extensibilityâ€”just add scripts to `scripts/`
- Discoverable and documented (via `help`)

## ðŸª„ Coming Soon?

- Optional test runner
- Tab completion
- Shared libraries (`lib/`)
- Flag/arg parsing improvements
